This Flask application incorporates a chatbot to retrieve information regarding government initiatives. Administrators can sign up, log in, and edit the specifics of their schemes. The program connects with a MongoDB database to store schemes and user details. Through the chatbot's capability, people can ask questions and get information about different government initiatives.
